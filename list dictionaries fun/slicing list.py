# Slicing a List in Python
# Slicing allows you to access a portion of a list by specifying a start and end index.
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  # Example of a list
# Slicing the list from index 2 to index 5 (exclusive)
sliced_list = lst[2:5]
print("Sliced List:", sliced_list)  # Output: [3, 4, 5]
