# Comprehensive Python File Handling Examples
"""
File Handling in Python

The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.
The open() function takes two parameters: filename and mode.

File Modes:
"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist
"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist  
"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

Text/Binary Modes:
"t" - Text - Default value. Text mode
"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)
