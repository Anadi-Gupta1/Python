# ðŸ“„ File Operations Security Guidelines

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

### File Permission Management
- Always check file permissions before operations
- Use appropriate access modes (read-only when possible)
- Implement proper user authentication for sensitive files

### Input Validation
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Sanitize user input for file names
- Check file extensions for security

### Error Handling
- Never expose system paths in error messages
- Log security events appropriately
- Handle exceptions gracefully without revealing internals

### Resource Management
- Always close files properly using context managers
- Monitor file handle usage
- Implement timeout mechanisms for long operations

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Guidelines

1. **Read Operations**: Use minimal permissions required
2. **Write Operations**: Validate data before writing
3. **Append Operations**: Check file integrity first
4. **Delete Operations**: Implement confirmation mechanisms

## ðŸ“Š Performance Considerations

- Use buffered operations for large files
- Implement progress tracking for long operations
- Consider memory usage for file processing
- Use streaming for very large files
