# Write a program to demonstrate basic data handling in PyTHON
#WHAT IS DATA HANDLING?
# Data handling refers to the process of collecting, storing, managing, and processing data in a structured manner.
# It involves various operations such as data input, validation, transformation, and output.
# Data handling is essential in programming as it allows developers to work with data effectively, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in applications.
# In Python, data handling can be achieved through various built-in functions, libraries, and data structures.
#What is Data
# Data is a collection of facts, statistics, or information that can be processed and analyzed.

#Types of data
# 1. Numeric Data: Represents numbers, such as integers and floating-point numbers.
# 2. String Data: Represents text, which can include letters, numbers, and symbols.
# 3. Boolean Data: Represents truth values, either True or False.
# 4. List Data: Represents an ordered collection of items, which can be of different data types.
# 5. Tuple Data: Similar to lists, but immutable (cannot be changed after creation
# 6. Dictionary Data: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, allowing for efficient data retrieval.

#what is squence
# A sequence is an ordered collection of items that can be indexed and iterated over.
# sequence is a continous memore allocation of data in this data are sotred in memore in a linear manner
