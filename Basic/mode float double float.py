#modulus in python
# Modulus in Python is performed using the percent sign (%) operator.
# It returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.
# modulus reaminder deta hai seedhe seedhe after division
# Example of modulus
a = 25
b = 7
c = a % b
print(c)
# what is flow division in python?
# Flow division in Python is performed using the double slash operator (//).
# It divides the first operand by the second and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.
# Example of flow division
a = 10
b = 3
c = a // b
print(c)
# flow division ka matlab hai ki jo bhi result aayega uska integer part hi return karega
# Example of float division
a = 10
b = 3
c = a / b
print(c)    
# float division ka matlab hai ki jo bhi result aayega uska decimal part bhi return karega
# Example of float and double in Python
a = 10.5  # float
b = 20.25  # float
c = 30.75  # float
d = a + b + c  # float addition
print("The sum of float numbers is:", d)
# Example of double in Python (Python does not have a separate double type, it uses float for both)
e = 1000000000.123456789  # large float value
print("A large float value (double equivalent):", e)
# Example of float and double in Python
# Python does not have a separate double type, it uses float for both
# Example of float and double in Python
a = 10.5  # float
b = 20.25  # float
c = 30.75  # float
d = a + b + c  # float addition
print("The sum of float numbers is:", d)


a = 14
b = 6
c = a //b
print("The result of flow division is:", c)

# in flow divion if the divde the one number by another number and if it less than 5 or 5 it we get the resut as a quotient
# but the if we divide the one number by another number and if it greater than 5 we get the result as remainder
